Perception
the interpretation of the input into the system (brain)


Sensation
the processing of raw input into the system (brain)


Eye Processing
cornea, iris/pupil, lens, retina
understanding rods and cones, blind spots, the optic nerve


Dorsal pathway
the where system


Ventral pathway
the what system


Bottom Up processing
creating a picture of perception based on the sensory input


Top down processing
creating a picture of perception based on background knowledge, expectations


Visual field
the outside world that you are getting sensation from


Receptive Field
the area of the brain that processes specific sensations


Cells (off-on)
cells that control color/motion/edge detection that are paired to responding positive to one thing and negatively to another


Figure/Ground
foreground and background information in perception


Grouping Principles
closure, similarity, good continuation, proximity


Depth Processing (Visual Cliff)
study showed that processing is learned


Binocular Cues
retinal disparity, motion parallax


Monocular Cues
linear perspective, aerial perspective, light/dark, occlusion, texture gradient


Visual Agnosia
a problem with perception, apperceptive (simple objects), associative (complex objects)

Recognition
the process of matching a stored representation to current sensory input


Template matching theory
says we match everything to a specific template stored in the brain


Feature Matching theory
says we match things based on a set of specific features required for the object


Recognition by components theory
tries to explain 3D perception with geons


Configural models
best explains face processing by looking at required configurations of objects


Word superiority
the way we perceive letters to always spell a word


Constancies
our perceptions stay the same even if the brightness, color, size, shape change


Illusions
inaccurate perceptions


Meuller-Lyer
linear perspective illusion


Ames Room Illusion
illusion that explores our rectangularity assumptions


Nystagmus
eye jitters 


Gardner Dragon
illusion that explores face perception (depth cues) based on a hollow face
