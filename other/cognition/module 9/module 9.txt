Forgetting
when retrieval processes fail to bring information into short term memory


Ebbinghaus
an original researcher in forgetting that showed the curve of forgetting


Retention Interval
the time between learning and retrieval


Decay Theory
information fades over time, use it or lose it
similar to transience theory 

Interference theory
information has competition in memory and you can't figure out which memory is correct
similar to blocking theory


Retroactive Interference
when new stuff makes you forget old stuff


Proactive Interference
when old stuff makes you forget new stuff


Motivated Forgetting
when you purposely try to forget memories


Encoding Failure
when you do not pay attention and properly encode information
similar to absentmindedness


Retrieval Failure
when you cannot retrieve the proper memory


7 Sins of memory
theories on how memories are distorted and forgotten


Transience
forgetting over time
similar to decay theory


Absent mindedness
improper encoding leads to forgetting
similar to encoding failure


Blocking
information is blocked by other similar information 
similar to interference theory


Output interference
the act of remembering blocks other relevant memories


Misattribution
attributing memory to the wrong person, place, time


Suggestibility
distorting memory based on information presented at the time of re-encoding that is very similar


Bias
our beliefs about the way the world works distorts our memories


Consistency bias
the belief that we have consistent attitudes, so we distort memories to match current feelings


Persistence
the inability to forget


Rebound effect
the looping of memories that we would like to forget (getting something stuck in your head)


Retrograde amnesia
forgetting past events


Anterograde
forgetting of new events


Causes of Amnesia
retro: concussion, korsakoff's, encephalitis 
antero: damage to the hippocampus
