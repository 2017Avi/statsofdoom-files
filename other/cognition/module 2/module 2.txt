Artificial Intelligence
The design of a computer to mimic the mind/act like a human, inspires other research on cognition


Mind-Brain
The mind-brain approach attempts to determine where the mind and brain connect

Using the computer as a way to understand human thinking


Mental Representations
A physical depiction of an object – can be neural, paper, stop sign, etc. This definition is our term for the building blocks of knowledge/memory.


Mental Processing (there are 3 parts)
Process, processing system, algorithm – the ways we define the information processing process


Experiments
Looking for causal relationships between variables, must manipulate variables


IV/DV/Noise
Independent variables are the manipulated factors, dependent variables are the measured variable we hope to change, noise variables are those factors that we know interact with our variable but we don’t care about them.
