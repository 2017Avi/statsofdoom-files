Knowledge
information that is represented memory 


Intentionality criterion
representations must be constructed on purpose and carry information


Modality specific
representations that match the way they were first input (images, words)


Image representations
include a spatiotemporal window, storage unites, and stored information about a scene


Feature records
the combinations of many different perceptual inputs


Amodal symbols
frames, semantic networks, and property lists
things that are not represented as visual or verbal information 


Neural nets
statistical approach to understanding representations in the brain, memories are like bar codes


Categories
representation of specific knowledge in a generalized way


Feature Comparison Theory
category creation theory that says we store a list of necessary features for a concept to compare against


Defining/Characteristic
the types of necessary features in feature comparison theory


Typicality Effect
responses are faster to typical features over atypical features (dogs have fur versus skin)


Prototypes
an abstract concept that is used to determine if a new member is part of a category


Prototypicality
responses are faster to typical members over atypical members of a category (robin > penguin)


Superordinate
the highest level of category structure, considered the most abstract


Basic Level
the special level of category structure, usually used for naming, mostly where the prototype/exemplar is stored


Subordinate
the most concrete level of category structure, where concepts are specific members of a category


Brains for category structure
see different activations for superordinate (PFC) and subordinate (parietal/occipital)


Exemplars
specific examples of a concept are used to determine category membership


Network Models
the combination of feature comparison, prototype and exemplar theory that emphasizes the connections between items


Parallel Distributed processing
type of network model proposed for category learning


Schemas 
a heuristic for understanding specific types of categories


Scripts
a set of steps/procedures for schemas


Frames
details about the specific events within a script


Default Values
the most common values within a schema
