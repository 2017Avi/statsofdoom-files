Attention
the ability to focus on some things while ignoring others


Change Blindness
missing a change in your visual field


Focused attention
doing one thing at a time


Divided attention
performing multiple tasks at the same time


Attention blink
when we miss a target presented 200-500 msec after a first target appears


Two-stage model
tries to explain the attention blink as a decay (wait) process

Interference model
tries to explain the attention blink as an interference process (fight)

Combination model
says that the attention blink is both intereference and decay processes


Central interest information
explanation of why we miss changes because we are so focused on these pieces


Endogenous attention
controlled attention from top down processes


Exogenous attention
uncontrolled attention from bottom up processes



Posner Cueing Paradigm
a visual cue task that showed the differences between endogenous and exogenous attention


Visual Search
a task that showed how conjunctive and disjunctive searches worked for targets


Dichotic Listening Task
a task that required you to shadow (repeat) one ear back while ignoring the other ear


Early bottleneck
says that the information is filtered before we process for semantics


Late bottleneck 
says that the information is filtered after we process for semantics


Attenuation theory
says that the information is just turned down and we can go back to it if it becomes important to us


Feature Integration theory
an understanding of how we put together different features in our visual field
