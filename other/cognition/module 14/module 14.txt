Psycholinguistics
study of the psychology of language


Language is special theory
theory that language is a special mental module that is different from other cognitive processes
chomsky, pinker
nature, nativist


Language is like everything else theory
theory that language is learned and processed just like every other sound in the brain
tomasello
emergent, nurture


Cross linguistic consistencies
idea that all languages share different language rules that shouldn't happen if they were truly learned
semanticity, arbitrary, flexibility, naming, displacement, productivity


Critical periods
supports both theories
idea that there is a window of time (genetics) that we have to hear language (environment) to get language fully


Broca's 
speech production center, syntax is impaired in aphasia


Wernicke's 
speech comprehension center, semantics is impaired in aphasia


Universal grammar
Chomsky's idea of prebuilt grammar, since only two possible word orders are commonly represented


Transformational grammar
how we comprehend sentence structure into meaning
does not explain how we interpret ambiguity


Plasticity
recovery from brain damage


Grammar 
understanding structure in language


Discourse
larger structure of language (like paragraphs)


Propositions
smaller chunks of language (like clauses)


Syntax
grammatical rules between words in a sentence


Phrase structure tree
sometimes called parse tree
hierarchical structure of a sentence

Aphasia
a language or speech disruption


Morphemes
smallest unit of meaning


Phonemes
smallest unit of sound


Ambiguity
more than one interpretation of a sentence


Garden path sentences
ways to study ambiguity by leading the reader astray


Spectrogram
a way to display articulation of speech


Coarticulation
overlapping of phonemes


Phoneme restoration 
where you fill in missing sounds to complete the most likely word you heard


Cohort
a list of words that sound or look the same to the target word


McGurk effect
differences in speech perception because visual and auditory cues do not match


Profanity
words that are used socially to be rude/insulting
now we think of them as ways to connect to audience


Uses of cursing
dysphemistic, abusive, idiomatic, empathic, cathartic


Strength of cursing
goes up for racial slurs
goes down with interaction in environment (exposure)
depends on culture


Differences in word origin
fuck versus bitch show interesting patterns of usage that imply the sociocultural change of word use across time
