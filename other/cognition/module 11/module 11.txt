Problem Solving
a situation in which we have to overcome obstacles to get to a goal


Ill-Defined Problems
problems without clearly defined operators, initial or goal states


Well-Defined Problems
problems with clearly defined operators, initial, and goal states


Insight problems
ill defined problems wherein the answer comes to you in an AHA moment
cake problem, nine dot problem, etc.


Problem Space Theory
theory that states that we solve problems by examining all the possible steps/options from initial to goal state


Goal States
initial state is the start of the problem, while the goal state is the end of the problem


Operators
available actions we have to work through the states of a problem


Search Trees
the map of all possible states from initial to goal state


Heuristics
an operator that's may solve the problem, usually considered a rule of thumb


Random Search
a heuristic that is trial and error to solving the problem


Hill Climbing
a heuristic that is always moving one step closer to the goal


Means-Ends Analysis
a heuristic that breaks down large goals into subgoals


Backup avoidance
a problem that you see with children and damage to the pre-frontal cortex wherein people do not want to undo a step that they have previously done even if it is required to solve the problem


Analogies
operator that says we use similar problems to solve current problems


Analogy steps
retrieval, mapping, evaluating, testing an analogy to determine if it helps solve the problem


Algorithms
operator that always solves the problem, albeit slowly


Brain
problem solving appears to be in the prefrontal cortex


Tower of Hanoi
a well defined problem where people move disks among pegs with specific operators


Functional Fixedness
getting stuck in a problem
you can only think of the typical usage for an object
