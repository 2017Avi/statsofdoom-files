Neurons
cells that send messages in the brain


Types of Neurons
sensory, motor, interneurons, each connected to their systems


Myelin
the coating on the axon that controls the speed of processing for the action potential


Synapse
the space between cells, used to communicate between neurons


The Mexican Wave / Action potentials 
the electrical process of communication for the neuron


Neurotransmitters
the chemical process of communication for the neuron, dopamine


Frontal Lobe
the front of the brain that controls abstract thinking


Motor cortex
in the frontal lobe that controls movement


Broca’s
in the frontal lobe that controls speech production (what to say)


Parietal Lobe
the top of the brain that controls memory and spatial locations


Sensory Cortex (somatosensory)
in the parietal lobe that controls sensation


Occipital Lobe
back of the brain that controls vision


Temporal Lobe
side of the brain that controls hearing and memory


Wernicke’s
in the temporal lobe that controls speech comprehension


Sub-cortical areas
hippocampus and amygdala controlling memory and emotion


Corpus Callosum
thick band of neurons that controls the connection between the left and right hemisphere


Sperry’s Split Brain
study that showed how the connections between the left and right hemisphere were important

Correlational brain research
EEG, EMG, ERP, PET scans, fMRIs, optics, etc. (be sure to know good/bad for these)

Causal brain research
lesions, aphasias, drugs, TMS (be sure to know pros/cons)

Behavioral research
judgments, protocol collection, response times, accuracy (be sure to know pros/cons)

Computer Modeling
a way to explain the neural connections using a computer
