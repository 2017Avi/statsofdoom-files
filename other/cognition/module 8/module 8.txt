Hippocampus
area of the brain involved in consolidation of memory


Prefrontal regions
area of the brain involved in the making of memories (paying attention)


Lashley
researcher who studied how information is stored in memory


Atkinson and Shriffrin Model of memory
three stage model of memory that shows how information comes into sensory memory and is stored in long term memory


Sensory memory
first stage of memory, temporary store for sensation


Studying sensory memory (sperling)
Sperling showed that sensory memory is brief but large by using a quick visual task that people had to report specific lines of a square of text


Iconic
visual store in sensory memory


Echoic
auditory store in sensory memory


Short term memory
second stage of memory that is the working area of memory
capacity is limited (7 +/- 2) and temporary duration without rehearsal 


Working memory
in short term memory the area where information is being actively processed


Memory span
the number of items a person can work with in working memory


Chunking
grouping information into logical pieces to help with memory
 

Baddeleyâ€™s theory of working memory
three part model of working memory with the phonological loop, central executive, and visuo-spatial sketchpad


Phonological loop
the verbal store for working memory


Central executive
the cop system that controls information going into other components of working memory


Visuo-spatial sketchpad
the visual and spatial store for working memory


Measuring Working Memory
using span tasks such as the OSPAN, digit span, etc.


Attention + WM
the idea that working memory is the ability to focus attention


Anti saccade
the task used to study working memory and attention
must look away from a cue on the screen


Cocktail party
the effect wherein you hear your name more often than anything else
the task used to study working memory and attention


Inhibition + WM
the idea that working memory is the ability to filter other things out


Expertise
working memory shows expertise effects with being able to chunk better


Long Term memory
the permanent store of information


Declarative
explicit memory that we can consciously recall


Semantic Memory
our fact based system, mental dictionary


Episodic Memory
our life event based system, mental diary


Source amnesia
not remembering where/when/who you learned something from


HM
patient with no hippocampus that had no new learning of memories (episodic) with very little semantic memory


Encoding
the process of storing information to go into long term memory from short term memory


Consolidation
the process of making memories permanent 


Elaboration
linking new information to older information already in memory


Attention + LTM
the idea that information not attended to will not go into long term memory


Levels of processing
the idea that information that is processed at a deeper level (i.e. semantically) will be remembered better


Incidental learning
the idea that some information is learned by accident when you are not trying


Transfer appropriate processing
the idea that information is learned better when the encoding and retrieval processes match


Encoding specificity
the idea that information is learned better when the encoding and retrieval situations match


Generation effect
information that you come up with is learned better than information given to you to learn


Spacing effect
learning across many trials spaced out is better


Non-declarative
implicit memory, unconscious processes


Priming
the idea that the second time a stimulus is seen/heard you will be faster/better

Perceptual
increased performance for visual objects


Conceptual
increased performance for semantically related objects


Classical conditioning
stimulus response learning
