# Path Day 2 Class Assignment

## Create a model using the correlation table and figure on Blackboard.  

## Run the fit of the model.

## Include the fit indices using fitMeasures().

## Include a picture of the model. 

## For model 2, remove either the environmental component (withdrawal and aggression) or the genetic component (age, education used as a proxy for IQ). 

## Run the fit of the model.

## Include the fit indices using fitMeasures().

## Include a picture of the model. 

## Compare the models based on the most common fit measures: Chi-square, RMSEA, SRMR, CFI, TLI, NFI, AIC, and ECVI.
    a. Which model is better?
    b. Interpret the loadings of the better model. What do they seem to imply? Are they significant?
