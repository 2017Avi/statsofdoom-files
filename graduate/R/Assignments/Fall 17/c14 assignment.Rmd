# Abstract

The present preliminary trials tested whether undergraduate peer leaders can effectively deliver a dissonance-based eating disorder prevention program, which could facilitate broad dissemination of this efficacious intervention. In Study 1, female undergraduates were randomized to peer-led groups, clinician-led groups, or an educational brochure control condition. Participants in peer- and clinician-led groups showed significantly greater preâ€“post reductions in eating disorder symptoms than controls, though clinician- versus peer-led groups produced stronger effects at posttest and at 1-year follow-up. Results provide novel evidence that dissonance-based eating disorder prevention groups led by undergraduate peers are feasible and produce greater reductions in eating disorder risk factors and symptoms than minimal-intervention control conditions, but indicate that effects are smaller for peer- versus clinician-led groups.

# Dataset:

    - Type of prevention program: peer-led, clinician-led, educational brochure
    - Testing time: eating disorder symptoms average, 1-10 scale where low scores indicate fewer symptoms 
        - Pre-test
        - Post-test
        - 1 year follow up
