# Dataset:
350 students were given a short questionnaire about their perception of parking space available on campus. The participants were first asked demographic information: 
    
    a) Gender 
    b)	Class level (freshman, sophomore, junior, senior) 

Next, participants were asked to indicate their opinion on three questions on parking lot space a 1-7 likert-type scale (1 = strongly disagree, 7 = strongly agree).
    
    a)	I always drive to campus.
    b)	I spend several minutes each day looking for parking.
    c)	I think MSU should build additional parking.
    
```{r starting}

```

# Data screening:

## Accuracy:
    a)	Include output and indicate how the data are not accurate.
    b)	Include output to show how you fixed the accuracy errors, and describe what you did.
    
```{r accuracy}

```

## Missing data:
    a)	Include output that shows you have missing data.
    b)	Include output and a description that shows what you did with the missing data.
        i)	Replace all participant data if they have less than or equal to 20% of missing data by row. 
        ii)	You can leave out the other participants (i.e. you do not have to create allrows). 
        
```{r missing}

```

## Outliers:
    a)	Include a summary of your mahal scores that are greater than the cutoff.
    b)	What are the df for your Mahalanobis cutoff?
    c)	What is the cut off score for your Mahalanobis measure?
    d)	How many outliers did you have?
    e)	Delete all outliers. 
    
```{r outliers}

```

# Assumptions:

## Additivity: 
    a)  Include the symnum bivariate correlation table of your continuous measures.
    b)  Do you meet the assumption for additivity?
    
```{r additivity}

```

## Linearity: 
    a)  Include a picture that shows how you might assess multivariate linearity.
    b)  Do you think you've met the assumption for linearity?
    
```{r linearity}

```

## Normality: 
    a)  Include a picture that shows how you might assess multivariate normality.
    b)  Do you think you've met the assumption for normality? 

```{r normality}

```

## Homogeneity/Homoscedasticity: 
    a)  Include a picture that shows how you might assess multivariate homogeneity.
    b)  Do you think you've met the assumption for homogeneity?
    c)  Do you think you've met the assumption for homoscedasticity?

```{r homog-s}
